I am a R&D engineer at GIGABYTE. The main areas are C++ Windows development, web frontend and crawlers.

I love open source. In my spare time, I always write some gadgets and plug-ins. For example, VSCode extension [Google Translate](https://github.com/imlinhanchao/vsc-google-translate), [Markdown Image](https://github.com/imlinhanchao/vsc-markdown-image). System gadget [KeyGenius](https://github.com/imlinhanchao/KeyGenius), website application [Librejo](https://github.com/imlinhanchao/librejo), [Eng](https://github.com/imlinhanchao/eng), [Invitation Card Maker](https://github.com/imlinhanchao/invitation-card-maker), etc.

Welcome to experience my open source products. If you have any problems or needs, you can raise them in the issue.
